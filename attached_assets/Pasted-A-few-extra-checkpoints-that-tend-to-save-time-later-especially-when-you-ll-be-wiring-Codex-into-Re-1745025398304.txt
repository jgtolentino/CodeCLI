A few extra checkpoints that tend to save time later, especially when you’ll be wiring Codex into Replit and CI:

1. Environment variables and secrets  
   • Does the README describe a `.env` file or expect variables passed at the CLI?  
   • Any hard‑coded values (e.g., site URL) that need a safer override mechanism for staging and prod.

2. Node tooling and linting  
   • Look for an explicit `engines` field in `package.json`; Replit’s default Node may differ.  
   • Presence of ESLint/Prettier or Husky hooks—important if they’ll block commits.

3. Testing and CI status  
   • Are there unit or integration tests you can run to confirm a clean clone builds?  
   • Any GitHub Actions badges referencing a failing build you should note.

4. Asset and image handling  
   • Whether Codex copies images verbatim, optimizes them, or expects an external pipeline (Sharp, imagemin).  
   • If the README warns about large build sizes or offers flags for asset hashing, jot that down.

5. Theme or styling system  
   • Check if it bundles a default Tailwind / Bootstrap config or encourages CSS‑in‑JS.  
   • Good to know in case we want to swap branding colors later.

6. Accessibility guidance  
   • Any mention of ARIA, semantic HTML, or Lighthouse targets—helps us keep compliance in scope.

7. Internationalization / localization hooks  
   • Even if you don’t need them now, note if Codex has a strategy for multiple locales (folder‑based vs runtime).

8. Performance and SEO notes  
   • Does the generator output pre‑rendered metadata, sitemap, RSS, or OpenGraph tags by default?  
   • Any guidance on core web vitals (hydration strategy, script splitting).

9. Branching/versioning model  
   • If the README references a `develop` branch or tags releases (v1.x vs main), capture that so we track against a stable version.

10. Community engagement  
   • CONTRIBUTING.md, code of conduct, or open issues that signal active maintenance—or lack thereof—useful when deciding how deep to customize.

Let me know if you uncover anything unexpected—especially around output directory naming or required global CLIs—and I’ll help adjust the implementation plan.
