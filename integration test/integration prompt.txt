# Test Prompt for Integration

Please help me understand how to use paths with spaces in bash scripts.
For example, how would I access a file at:
"/Users/tbwa/My Drive/tools/ClaudeOptimizer/data/samples/simple_prompt.txt"?

## Additional Questions
- How can I run the Claude Optimizer tool from Codex CLI?
- What's the best way to handle paths with spaces in shell scripts?
